March Madness analysis using Twitter data in PySpark 💥

The goal of this end-to-end Twitter project is to leverage big data technologies to analyze Twitter data and drive insights around the topic of March Madness - U.S college basketball tournament for the national championship during March. In this project, I practiced designing data architecture, using big data tools, and implementing graph and ML techniques to analyze hashtags and tweets.

· Created ingestion using NiFi and stored the data in Hadoop__
· Conducted social network analysis using GraphFrame to identify common and relevant hashtags and communities, visualized the graph__
· Conducted bot detection and sentiment classification using SparkML__
